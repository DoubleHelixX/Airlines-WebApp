Open Via Visual Studio

About:
My first ASP.net Project that was done using Visual Studio for my CST 4708 - Software Development and the .NET Framework class.

What is it:
A web project done using ASP.Net to grasp the concept of Web programming.

Relevant Features: C#, ASP.Net, Sessions, Redirects

Description:
In our project do the following:

step 1: The first screen has just the destination site. From a dropdown box, the user picks the City. Populate the box with multiple cities of your choice. This screen only has a greeting, label and dropdown with cities.

step 2: The departure destination is passed to the next page and based upon the departure destination, only certain cities are shown for the arrival city. You can make up these rules. A good example would be to pick cities in the same state as the destination city.

step 3: The third picks up two data fields for departure and arrival. Optionally you can pick up the time. The user picks the date (and optionally time), versus being presented with choices.

step 4: The last screen , in an English sentence , print out the itinerary such as :
Your flight leaves November 19, 2019 from New York and arrives in Buffalo on November 20, 2019.
